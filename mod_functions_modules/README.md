# ASSIGNMENT 3:

####    Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

###### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

    User will enter the number of choice and function named as factorial will calculate the factorail of number which user entered.
    Given two condition and used OR logical operator :
        1. If user enter 0(zero) so 1 will returned as 0! =1
        2. If user enter 1 so its factorial is 1 as 1!=1
